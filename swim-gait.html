    <h1>Swim Gait Optimization</h1>

    <p>
      As part of the Kent State University 2025 REU Program, I worked 
      closely with Professor Xuanhong An, using an adjoint-based 
      gradient descent optimization algorithm to optimize the swim gait 
      of stiff-fin Ostraciiform fish. My work focused on three areas:
      characterization of the algorithm, establishment of a biological
      baseline swim gait, and optimization tests for comparison against 
      the baseline.

      <h2>Marsupial Robots: MotherBot and BabyBot</h2>

      <p>
        Inspired by pouched marsupials, MotherBot and BabyBot work as a team,
        allowing each subsystem to optimize for different tasks. MotherBot 
        uses her bulk to handles the drop test and ramp, then navigates the
        chute, reaches over the wall, and places BabyBot safely on the other 
        side, ready to identify the drop point and deliver the medkit. 
      </p>
    </div>

      <p>
        This dual design avoids compromises on durability or stability that
        more typical wall-breach methods require. MotherBot protects BabyBot 
        during the drop test using a tensioned line so the large moment is 
        applied through the reinforced drivetrain rather than the more 
        fragile medkit launcher mechanism.
      </p>
      <p>
        Choosing a more complex design posed a serious risk in terms of 
        exposure to more failure points and a higher workload, but our 
        team felt confident making the choice to move forward. With a 
        solid project management structure and 11 hands on deck, we 
        wanted to appropriately challenge ourselves and build a SaRR 
        that was novel and reliable.

  <h2>Results</h2>

  <h3>1) Brainstorming</h3>
  <p>
    Early days were spent brainstorming, focusing on feasibility,
    reliability, and uniqueness. A decision matrix helped pare down
    ideas into a few key choices.
  </p>

  </div>

  <h3>2) Design</h3>
  <p>
    Initial designs were CADded in Creo and iterated aggressively
    through prototyping and failure. Failure can be a frustrating 
    process, but we worked to aggressively iterate and use our 
    failures as momentum towards success. Fail fast and fail 
    forward, as our project manager Ella would always say! We 
    also took this time to plan out a semester-long task schedule
    to ensure we hit our deadlines on time.

    Not all prototypes succeed first try, and sometimes you fail a lot faster than you do forward. Nothing to do but take it one step at a time and try again!

  <h3>3) Manufacturing</h3>
  <p>
    Robots were constructed from laser-cut acrylic, 3D-printed PET,
    welded steel, and machined aluminum using Princeton’s MAE machine 
    shop. Manufacturing took place on a rolling basis as CAD designs 
    were finalized. As an Electrical Engineer, it is very unusual to 
    get access to the machine shop, and I really enjoyed the hands 
    on process.

 </div>

  <h3>4) Electrical & Software</h3>
  <p>
    Both robots used a Teensy 4.1. Schematics, wiring harnesses, and 
    software were built in parallel with manufacturing to enable rapid 
    integration. Each robot had its own unique sensor arrays and power 
    requirements. Notable is MotherBot's hammerhead shark inspired 
    sensor mount for multidirectional distance sensing and light tracking.

  </div>

  <h3>5) Testing & Debugging</h3>
  <p>
    In the last two weeks before the deadline, we hit the ground running with iterative testing and debugging. The goal was to identify and fix any issues through sheer volume of repetition, and the robots succesfully fully completed the course during testing by the final day. 
    Some key fixes included rebuilding the pulley shaft attached to the BabyBot extension mechanism, adding spacers to the wheels to stop the tank drive from grinding into them, tuning BabyBot's archerfish inspired payload launcher's spring tension, and integrating recalibration code into the sensor systems to allow for automated calibration at different light levels.

  <p>
    This project was supported by Professor Xuanhong An, as well as the Kent State University REU program 
    in cooperation with the NSF. Additional thanks to Professors Tao Shen and Peter Palffy-Muhoray for 
    allowing me to participate in side projects in their labs, it was a lot of fun!
