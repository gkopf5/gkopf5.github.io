    <h1>Challenging Nature: Swim Gait Optimization</h1>
    <div class="underline"></div>

    <p>
      As part of the Kent State University 2025 REU Program, I worked 
      closely with Professor Xuanhong An, using an adjoint-based 
      gradient descent optimization algorithm to optimize the swim gait 
      of stiff-fin Ostraciiform fish. My work focused on three areas:
      characterization of the algorithm, establishment of a biological
      baseline swim gait, and optimization tests for comparison against 
      the baseline.

      <h2>Marsupial Robots: MotherBot and BabyBot</h2>

      <p>
        Inspired by pouched marsupials, MotherBot and BabyBot work as a team,
        allowing each subsystem to optimize for different tasks. MotherBot 
        uses her bulk to handles the drop test and ramp, then navigates the
        chute, reaches over the wall, and places BabyBot safely on the other 
        side, ready to identify the drop point and deliver the medkit.

        This dual design avoids compromises on durability or stability that
        more typical wall-breach methods require. MotherBot protects BabyBot 
        during the drop test using a tensioned line so the large moment is 
        applied through the reinforced drivetrain rather than the more 
        fragile medkit launcher mechanism.
      </p>
      <p>
        Choosing a more complex design posed a serious risk in terms of 
        exposure to more failure points and a higher workload, but our 
        team felt confident making the choice to move forward. With a 
        solid project management structure and 11 hands on deck, we 
        wanted to appropriately challenge ourselves and build a SaRR 
        that was novel and reliable.

  <h2>Results</h2>

  <h3>Single Fourier Mode Transformation</h3>
  <p>
    The algorithm was first run with a single fourier mode, which
    ended up producing around 90% of the final optimization results. 
    This was very impressive, and indicated either our initial 
    guess was very good or the alogrithm is more effective than
    initially realized at the chosen resolution.

  <h3>Optimized Vector Animation</h3>
  <p>
    Note the triple vorticies; it appears the algorithm has developed this unique swimming gait to take advantage of this trailing edge triple-vortice behavior, allowing for 
    small increases in efficiency compared to the simpler, single-vortex gait it started out with.

  <p>
    This project was supported by Professor Xuanhong An, as well as the Kent State University REU program 
    in cooperation with the NSF. Additional thanks to Professors Tao Shen and Peter Palffy-Muhoray for 
    allowing me to participate in side projects in their labs, it was a lot of fun!
