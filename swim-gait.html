    <h1>Challenging Nature: Swim Gait Optimization</h1>
    <div class="underline"></div>

    <p>
      As part of the Kent State University 2025 REU Program, I worked 
      closely with Professor Xuanhong An, using an adjoint-based 
      gradient descent optimization algorithm to optimize the swim gait 
      of stiff-fin Ostraciiform fish. My work focused on three areas:
      characterization of the algorithm, establishment of a biological
      baseline swim gait, and optimization tests for comparison against 
      the baseline.

      <h2>Optimizing Nature</h2>

      <p>
        The optimization algorithm is built around a custom-written CFD program 
        It simulates a caudal tail fin as a stiff board fixed in place as 
        incompressible fluid is moved across it. The simulation design is twofold:
        choosing a simplified model allows for the supercomputer cluster to 
        complete full depth optimization runs in a matter of hours instead of days, 
        and the stiff fin can be easily adapted to a robotic model for physical 
        confirmation of simulated results.

      <p>
        The math behind the optimization algorithm is better referenced in the
        attached report, but to create a brief overview, a set of fourier modes
        have parameters which represent the amplitude and period of the pitch
        and heave of the fin. These discretized vorticity equations can be plugged 
        into a 2D incompressible Navier Stokes solver and solved using gradient
        descent. However, our parameter had too many dimensions for traditional methods
        to be feasible, even with a supercomputer cluster. To combat this, an adjoint
        system was derived to solve for the gradient cost function. By looping through 
        the algorithm, we continually output the gradient with respect to our pitch
        and heave parameters, which are reinserted into the algorithm as inputs.
      </p>
      <p>
        My role in this project focused on cleaning up the algorithm, characterizing 
        and adjusting initial parameters, and developing and testing a biological baseline for 
        comparison.

<section class="portfolio" id="results">
  <h2>Process</h2>
<p>
    Let's walk through the process through which the optimization
  algorithm processes a set of initial conditions into optimized results. 
  </p>
  
  <h3>Single Fourier Mode Transformation</h3>
  <p>
    The algorithm was first run with a single fourier mode, which
    ended up producing around 90% of the final optimization results.
    The drag value being calculated here is not truly drag, but rather
    a measure of inefficiency. As it decreases, our fish loses less
    energy per stroke. Units are arbitrary. The single fourier mode 
    performed far better than expected and indicated either our initial 
    guess was very good or the alogrithm is more effective than
    initially hypothesized at the chosen resolution. 
  </p>

  <div class="project-image">
    <img src="images/fish/fish_graphic_1.png" alt="Fish Graphic 1 FT">
  </div>

  <h3>5 Fourier Mode Transformation</h3>
  <p>
    Inputting the results of our single fourier mode run into five fourier 
    modes expands the depth of our optimization. We see a marked decrease
    in drag, although it is an order of magnitude less impactful than 
    the single fourier mode run was. 
  </p>
  <div class="project-image">
    <img src="images/fish/fish_graphic_5.png" alt="Fish Graphic 5 FT">
  </div>

  <h3>10 Fourier Mode Transformation</h3>
  <p>
    Now at ten fourier modes, we see once again the change in drag is 
    another order of magnitude smaller. The algorithm is basically done 
    optimizing here, and only runs six cycles before it decides to finish.
  </p>

  <div class="project-image">
    <img src="images/fish/fish_graphic_10.png" alt="Fish Graphic 10 FT">
  </div>

  <h3>30 Fourier Mode Transformation</h3>
  <p>
    Thirty fourier modes basically does nothing to our efficiency. The 
    program waffles about for a few cycles then ends, indicating the 
    values input to it were about as efficient as possible.
  </p>

  </div>

  <h3>Optimized Vector Animation</h3>
  <p>
    Note the triple vorticies; it appears the algorithm has developed this unique swimming gait to take advantage of this trailing edge triple-vortice behavior, allowing for 
    small increases in efficiency compared to the simpler, single-vortex gait it started out with.

      <h2>Biological Baseline & Comparison</h2>

      <p>
        The attached report elaborates further about the reasoning behind the 
        biological baseline. As can be seen here, the biological baseline of
        ostraciiform swimmers is represented by Coe & Gutschmidt's OpenFOAM 
        simulation of model fish. In terms of drag and lift, their swimmers 
        are slightly more efficient than the initial conditions we started with. 
        However, our final optimized results show significant improvements in 
        both categories.

    This project was supported by Professor Xuanhong An, as well as the Kent State University REU program 
    in cooperation with the NSF. Additional thanks to Professors Tao Shen and Peter Palffy-Muhoray for 
    allowing me to participate in side projects in their labs, it was a lot of fun!
