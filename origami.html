    <p>
When it comes to determining the best choice for an autonomous, aquatic platform's propulsion system,
extant biological methods can have a number of advantages over traditional propeller
systems. Navigating tight or complex terrain such as coral reefs, traversing environments such as
dense seaweed forests that could tangle traditional propellers, as well as interacting with extant wildlife
without modifying their behaviors are all prescribed advantages of using systems that simulate
the swimming gait of natural organisms. These are swimming styles that have evolved over
billions of years to work effectively in their native niches. Copying those core design principles
into our robotic systems allows us to smoothly insert our devices into said niches while
maintaining simplicity and efficiency.
    </p>
    <p>
The goal of our project is to effectively create an origami-inspired propulsion system for an
aquatic robot that is based on the swimming method of a salp (salpidae), a gelatinous marine swimmer
related to jellyfish. The goal was to create a swimmer
that is less invasive than traditional propeller systems while being simpler and more energy efficient
than something like a fish-inspired design. Inspired by salps, this 
project aimed to replicate this jet propulstion style of movement with the bistable snapping 
of Kresling tubes to create an efficient model water propulsion system for 
robotic applications. The integration of origami design should allow for a
lightweight, durable, affordable, and simple-to-construct robot. The main application is intended
to be extended, non-invasive data collection on aquatic life in natural ecosystems.
