    <p>
      As part of MAE 322: Mechanical Design with Professor Daniel Nosenchuck,
      I worked in a group of 11 people on an 8-week project to design,
      manufacture, and automate a SaRR capable of surviving a 1-foot drop test,
      tracking light, navigating a ramp and chute, breaching a 1-foot wall,
      and delivering a medical payload to a randomized drop point. Our robot
      took inspiration from biological systems, allowing us to develop novel 
      solutions to the engineering challenges posed by the course. 
    </p>

    <p>
      As Electrical Lead, I designed and assembled the full wiring harnesses
      for both robots and took point on systems issues during programming,
      testing, and debugging.

      <h2>Marsupial Robots: MotherBot and BabyBot</h2>

      <p>
        Inspired by pouched marsupials, MotherBot and BabyBot work as a team,
        allowing each subsystem to optimize for different tasks. MotherBot 
        uses her bulk to handles the drop test and ramp, then navigates the
        chute, reaches over the wall, and places BabyBot safely on the other 
        side, ready to identify the drop point and deliver the medkit.

        This dual design avoids compromises on durability or stability that
        more typical wall-breach methods require. MotherBot protects BabyBot 
        during the drop test using a tensioned line so the large moment is 
        applied through the reinforced drivetrain rather than the more 
        fragile medkit launcher mechanism.

  <h2>The Process</h2>

  <h3>1) Brainstorming</h3>
  <p>
    Early days were spent brainstorming, focusing on feasibility,
    reliability, and uniqueness. A decision matrix helped pare down
    ideas into a few key choices.
  </p>

  <img src="images/decision_matrix.png" class="project-image">

  <h3>2) Design</h3>
  <p>
    Initial designs were CADded in Creo and iterated aggressively
    through prototyping and failure. Failure can be a frustrating 
    process, but we worked to aggressively iterate and use our 
    failures as momentum towards success. Fail fast and fail 
    forward, as our project manager Ella would always say! We 
    also took this time to plan out a semester-long task schedule
    to ensure we hit our deadlines on time.
  </p>

  <h3>3) Manufacturing</h3>
  <p>
    Robots were constructed from laser-cut acrylic, 3D-printed PET,
    welded steel, and machined aluminum using Princeton’s MAE machine 
    shop. Manufacturing took place on a rolling basis as CAD designs 
    were finalized. As an Electrical Engineer, it is very unusual to 
    get access to the machine shop, and I really enjoyed the hands 
    on process. 
  </p>

  <h3>4) Electrical & Software</h3>
  <p>
    Both robots used a Teensy 4.1. Schematics, wiring harnesses, and 
    software were built in parallel with manufacturing to enable rapid 
    integration. Each robot had its own unique sensor arrays and power 
    requirements. Notable is MotherBot's hammerhead shark inspired 
    sensor mount for multidirectional distance sensing and light tracking.

  <h2>6) Demo Day!</h2>

    With time up and robots ready, it was time to demo.

  <p>
    We were unfortunately unable to complete the course in its entirety 
    due to unprecedented overheating problems with the motor controllers 
    on the day of the demo (this was a critical mistake I made, assuming 
    the MCs would be fine because they worked during test runs without 
    rigorously stress testing them at high current load), but the robots 
    succesfully managed to complete every part of the course individually. 
    The whole team put in a monumental amount of effort into the 
    completion of this project, fighting flu season and finals to get it 
    done, and I couldn't be prouder of them.
