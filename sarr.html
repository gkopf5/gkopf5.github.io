    <p>
      As part of MAE 322: Mechanical Design with Professor Daniel Nosenchuck,
      I worked in a group of 11 students on an 8-week project to design,
      manufacture, and automate a Search and Rescue Robot (SaRR).
    </p>

    <p>
      The robot was required to survive a 1-foot drop test, track light,
      navigate ramps and chutes, breach a 1-foot wall, and deliver a medical
      payload to a randomized drop point.
    </p>

    <p>
      As Electrical Lead, I designed and assembled the full wiring harnesses
      for both robots and served as the primary systems integrator during
      programming, testing, and debugging.
